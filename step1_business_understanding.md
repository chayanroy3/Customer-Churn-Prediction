# 🎯 Step 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing

## 🔍 Business Problem
PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility provider for small and medium-sized enterprises, is experiencing **customer churn**. With increased competition in the energy sector, customers now have more options than ever, making retention a challenge. PowerCo has engaged data scientists to diagnose the root causes of churn and recommend data-driven solutions.

## ⚡ Understanding Churn
**Churn** occurs when customers leave PowerCo to opt for a competitor’s services. The key question to investigate is:  
➡️ *What factors influence customer churn?*  
One primary hypothesis is that **price sensitivity** plays a significant role in customer retention.

## 📌 Key Hypothesis
We hypothesize that:
✅ Customers are highly **price-sensitive**, meaning an increase in pricing could result in higher churn rates.  
✅ Other factors such as **customer service quality, energy type (clean vs. non-clean), contract terms, and geographical location** might also contribute to churn.

## 📊 Required Data
To test our hypothesis, we need access to:
📂 **Customer Data** – Industry, historical electricity consumption, contract duration, date joined, and other customer characteristics.  
📂 **Churn Data** – Information on whether a customer has left PowerCo.  
📂 **Historical Price Data** – The prices charged for electricity and gas at different time intervals.  
📂 **Competitor Pricing Data** (if available) – To compare PowerCo’s pricing strategy with competitors.  

## 🛠️ Approach to Analysis
1️⃣ **Define Price Sensitivity** – Establish a metric to quantify how customer churn correlates with price changes.  
2️⃣ **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering** – Clean the data, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features.  
3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify patterns in the data, visualize trends, and detect key correlations.  
4️⃣ **Modeling Churn Probability** – Use **binary classification models** like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosted Machines to predict churn probabilities.  
5️⃣ **Model Selection & Evaluation** – Compare different models based on accuracy, interpretability, and effectiveness in explaining churn.  

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
By completing this analysis, we aim to:
🚀 **Understand the key drivers of churn.**  
🚀 **Determine the extent to which price sensitivity influences customer retention.**  
🚀 **Provide actionable insights to PowerCo** to mitigate churn through pricing strategies and other retention initiatives.
